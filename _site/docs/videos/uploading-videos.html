    <p>To upload videos to your account, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">

      </li>
      <li>Videos can be uploaded using one of these methods:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Drag and Drop</strong> - Drag files from the file system to the Upload panel. The grey box becomes the drop zone. When the file is dropped, the upload process will begin.

          </li>
          <li><strong>File selection dialog</strong> - Click <strong>Browse for Videos</strong> to open a file selection dialog and then browse and select files to upload.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>After files are selected, the upload progress will display.  Click <strong>View and edit video details</strong> to view the video properties.

      </li>
    </ol>
    <div class="BCL-aside">Notes:
      <ul>
        <li>There is no file size limit. Brightcove has tested with uploads as large as 100GB without any issues.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>Once the files have been selected, the file upload will begin. To cancel the upload, click <strong>Cancel Upload</strong>. Click <strong>Dismiss</strong> to remove the file entry from the page. <strong>While uploads are in a processing state, do not close or move away from the browser window.</strong> Doing so may cause an incomplete upload.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"></figure>
    <p>When the upload is complete, a <strong>Processing Complete</strong> status will display. This indicates the processing has completed and it is safe to navigate from the Videos page.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/demand-gen/assets/images/videos/uploader-processing-complete.png" /></figure>
    <p>By default, when a video is uploaded, the status is set to Active unless required fields are missing. To learn more about video properties, see <a href="/node/15482">Editing Video Properties using the Media Module</a>.</p>
