    <p>Videos in your account have associated poster and thumbnail images. Poster and thumbnail images can be seen in the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>In the Videos list, the thumbnail image is displayed next to the video; the poster image will appear in the preview player on the video properties page</li>
      <li>The poster image is displayed in the playback area of the video player before or after video playback</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Poster and thumbnail images are created automatically by taking a snapshot from the source video at the midway point. </p>
    <p>It is also possible to <a href="/videos/uploading-poster-and-thumbnail-images.html">upload other images</a> to use as the poster and thumbnail.</p>
