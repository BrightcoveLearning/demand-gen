      <section class="bcls-section">    <p>There may be times when you want to replace the source file for a video. One common case is when you need to edit a video that was already published. If you delete the video and re-upload, you will have to re-enter all of the video metadata and you will lose any video analytics associated with the video.</p>
    <p>While the new renditions are being created, the video will remain playable using the existing renditions.</p>
    <p class="BCL-aside">Note: You cannot replace the source file for videos that have been shared to your account.</p>
    <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Video file names (including the extension) must not exceed 120 single-byte (60 double-byte) characters. If it does, the video will be ingested successfully, but you will not be able to retranscode it later.</p>

      <li>Click the link for the video you want to replace the source file for.</li>

      </li>
      <li>Select an ingest profile to use.
        <p class="BCL-aside">Note: Videos that were initially transcoded using a Dynamic Delivery or Context Aware ingest profile can only be retranscoded using one of those ingest profile types. Videos transcoded using a Legacy ingest profile can be retranscoded with any type of profile.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Use the Upload module to upload a new source file.</li>
      <li>Check <strong>Keep existing thumbnail and video still images</strong> to keep the existing thumbnail and poster images. Uncheck the option to have new images generated from the new source file.</li>
      <li>Check <strong>Keep existing audio tracks</strong> to keep the existing audio tracks. Uncheck the option to have new audio tracks generated from the new source file.

      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Process</strong> to begin the transcoding. A <strong>Processing Complete</strong> message will display. Note that there will be a delay before the updated renditions are available. Check the <strong>Upload Date</strong> values in the <strong>Video Files</strong> section of the Media module to verify that the new renditions are available.</li>
