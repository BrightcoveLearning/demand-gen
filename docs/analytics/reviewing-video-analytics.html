  <h1>Reviewing Video Analytics</h1>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Regardless of your specific goals for online video, understanding your audience is a key to developing a successful video strategy. The better you understand your viewers, the easier it is to create content that will engage them in formats they can easily consume. The Analytics page provides  analytics about how many views your videos have, how much content your viewers are watching and even when they stop watching videos.</p>
    <p>To view  Analytics in Brightcove Campaign, click <strong>Analytics</strong> in the navigation header.</p>

    <h2 id="timespan" class="BCL_conceptTitle">Selecting a time span</h2>
    <p>To specify the time period for analytics, click on a quick date or use the calendar control. Note that when a single day is selected, the graphs will display by hour.</p>
    <h3>Using a quick date</h3>
    <p>A series of quick dates are at the top of the page. The following quick dates are available:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Today</li>
      <li>Last 7 days</li>
      <li>Last 30 days</li>
      <li>This month - The calendar month to date - for example, if today is March 17, this report will display March 1 - March 17</li>
      <li>Last month - The previous calendar month - for example, if today is February 14, this report will display January 1 - January 31.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reporting time zone</h3>
    <p>Data on the Analytics page is shown using the account's reporting time zone. The time zone is displayed below the calendar control.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="time zone" src="/assets/images/analytics/timezone.png" /></figure>
    <p>The reporting time zone is used to calculate day boundaries for reporting data. Changing the reporting time zone setting only affects data going forward, and changes are not applied retroactively. If you change this setting, you may see a flat spot or a spike in your data when looking at day boundaries where the change was applied. Updates to this setting may not take effect immediately, and analytics data may continue to refer to the old setting until the system processes the changes.</p>
    <p>The reporting time zone can be configured as part of the account settings. For information on changing the reporting time zone, see <a href="/docs/admin/managing_account_settings.html#account_settings">Managing Account Settings</a>.</p>
