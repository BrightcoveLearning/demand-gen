  <h1>Managing Media Sharing Settings</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to configure Media Sharing settings.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Media sharing allows publishers to upload videos once and then share the videos to other accounts. The accounts can be your own, corporate accounts or accounts of other publishers. The shared videos can then be used independently in the other  accounts. The Media Sharing settings are used to manage the sharing relationships between accounts.</p>
    <p>This topic will use the following terminology:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Master</strong> - The account that created (uploaded) the original video. The Master owns the content and is responsible for setting up, managing and providing content to Affiliates.</li>
      <li><strong>Affiliate</strong> - The account that is receiving the video. The Affiliate can accept content shared to it from a Master.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="add_affiliates">Adding affiliates</h2>
    <p>To share videos to another account, an affiliate account must be added. An affiliate is an account you want to share videos to. To add an affiliate account, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Login to Brightcove Campaign.</li>
      <li>In the navigation header, open the Administration menu by clicking the gear icon (<img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="" src="/demand-gen/assets/images/admin/gear-icon.png" />) and then <strong> Media Sharing</strong>. Note that you must be an account administrator to access to the Administration menu.</li>
      <li>The <strong>Manage Affiliates - Accounts I Share Videos With</strong> section will display a list of all the affiliate publishers (if any) with which you have established a media sharing relationship.

      </li>
      <li>To add a new affiliate, enter their Account ID in the <strong>Account ID</strong> textbox and then click <strong>Add Affiliate</strong>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The account will be added to the table with a <strong>Relationship Status</strong> of <strong>Pending</strong>. The affiliate account will receive a media sharing notification and be able to <a href="#accept_reject">accept or reject the relationship</a>. If the affiliate accepts the media sharing relationship, the <strong>Relationship Status</strong> will be <strong>Accepted</strong>.</p>
