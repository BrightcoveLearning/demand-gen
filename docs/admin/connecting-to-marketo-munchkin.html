  <h1>Connecting to Marketo using Munchkin</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to configure Brightcove Campaign for use with Marketo using Munchkin.</summary>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <p>Brightcove Campaign can be configured to integrate with  Marketo. When the integration is configured,  video engagement data for videos published using Brightcove Campaign is  synchronized to  Marketo. Once in Marketo, this data can be used for segmentation, campaign logic, reports, lead scoring, and personalizing communications.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: For information on how to configure Brightcove Campaign for use with Marketo using the REST APIs, see <a href="connecting-to-marketo-rest-api.html">Connecting to Marketo using the REST APIs</a>.</aside>
    <p>Some of the key features of the  Marketo integration are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data format</strong> - Video  viewing data is delivered to Marketo as a page view, or a virtual web visit. The web page visit event contains query parameters that indicate the viewer's level of engagement. The data that is replicated to Marketo is as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Video Name</li>
          <li>Video ID</li>
          <li>Brightcove Account ID</li>
          <li>Page URL of the referring page</li>
          <li>Brightcove Player ID</li>
          <li>% Watched</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Data transfer</strong> - Viewing data is sent immediately to Marketo, however, some reports in the Marketo platform may take some time to refresh</li>
    </ul>
    To use Brightcove Campaign with Marketo Munchkin, you must have a Marketo account with the Munchkin API enabled - you will need your Munchkin account ID (see <a href="#marketo">Accessing the Marketo munchkin</a> below). Users with the Munchkin User role should be able to access these values.</section>
